            <h1>Site report for the website Alan biju's Portfolio</h1>
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
            Hi my name is Alan Biju and this is my portfolio website. <br>
            This website is a project for the web development course at the university of the Northampton. <br>
            The website is a simple portfolio website that showcases , my details, my projects, contact information, site report and with a small video demostration. <br>
            The website is designed to be simple and easy to navigate. <br>
            </p>
            <h5>learning experience</h5>
            <p>
            Throughout the module I emberked on a journey to learn web development from scratch. <br>
            I have learned a lot from this project. <br>
            I have learned how to create a website from scratch using HTML and CSS. <br>
            I have learned how to use flexbox and grid to create a responsive layout. <br>
            I have learned how to use media queries to make the website responsive. <br>
            I have learned how to use JavaScript to create a hamburger menu. <br>
            I have learned how to use git and github to manage my project. <br>
            I gained a lot of experience from this project and I am happy with the end result, which helped me gain confidence for the future. <br><br>
            The debugging process was like a rollercoaster ride, I had to go through a lot of errors and bugs(for example, like typos and forgotten to close the tags and so on) to get the website to work properly. <br>
            I also learned the importance of responsive design ,testing my site on different screen sizes and fixing layout shifts with media queries. <br>
            </p>
            <h5>site development and design decisions</h5>
            <p>
                For the UI, I wanted a clean and modern aesthetic. <br>
                I chose a arial sans-serif font family for all text in my website as it was a intersting and elegant font. <br>
                I used a color scheme of black, white and blue for the website with background image as wonderful gif which related to technology, I liked that one because of that circular movement which shows the link between human life and technology. <br>
                I used a hamburger menu for the navigation on mobile devices. <br>
                I used a flexbox for the layout of the website. <br>
                I used a grid for the project section to display the projects in a grid layout. <br>
                I used a media query to make the website responsive. <br>
                I opted for simple and clean navigation bar and section divisions. <br><br>
                I experimented with color plaettes using colorhunt.co and coolors.co to find the right color scheme for the website. <br>
                I ensured that the website was accessible and easy to navigate. <br>
                I used the colours like turquoise,marigold and amber color which represent the truth about love from diverse sides(like enduring love, warm love,joyous love)<br>
                And used interactive elements like hover effects and transitions to make the website more engaging. <br>
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
                I am happy with the end result of the website. <br>
                Overall, I am happy with the design and layout of the website. <br>
                This project taught me resilience and problem solving<br>
                Each challenge I faced was a learning opportunity. <br> 
                I now appreciate the importance of responsive design and accessibility. <br>
                Also this encourage me to do more work in complex and dynamic sites in the future.<br><br>
                I'm pround of the progress I have made and gateful for the resources and feedback that guided me through this project. <br>
                thanks for everything.<br><br>
